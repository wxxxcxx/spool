//! Runs the Lua interpreter on a thread of its own.
//!
//! `mlua::Lua` is `!Send`, and a handler is arbitrary script code of unbounded
//! duration, so it cannot run on the main thread without blocking window
//! management for as long as it takes. The main thread only sends
//! ([`ToLua`]) and drains ([`FromLua`]) over unbounded, non-blocking
//! channels; world reads ([`WorldRequest`]) and script-state access
//! ([`StoreRequest`]) go through their own reply channels, so a handler
//! awaiting an answer never blocks the others. Nothing crossing either
//! channel is a Lua value — only plain data ([`LuaEvent`], [`WindowSet`],
//! [`Command`], [`PaneruQueryState`]); see [`super::convert`] for the
//! marshalling.
