//! Embedded Lua scripting runtime (mlua).
//!
//! Lets a user's `init.lua` hook into window-manager events (`spool.on`),
//! bind keys to Lua callbacks or actions (`spool.bind`), read state via
//! `spool.query*`, and dispatch actions via `spool.run`.
//!
//! The interpreter runs on its own thread (see [`worker`]), not the main
//! thread: a handler is arbitrary user code of unbounded duration, and the
//! main thread hosts the Cocoa event pump, which a slow handler must not
//! freeze. As a result, `spool.query*` results are up to about a frame
//! stale, and actions a handler issues reach the action bus a frame later
//! than synchronous dispatch would. Handlers in a batch run concurrently;
//! actions from any one handler stay in the order it queued them, but
//! ordering across handlers follows completion, not registration.
//!
//! Every system takes the worker as `Option<Res<LuaWorker>>` so the mock test
//! harness (which never starts one) keeps compiling and no-ops gracefully.
