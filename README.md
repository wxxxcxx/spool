# Spool

A sliding, tiling window manager for macOS, built around a continuous strip of
windows that moves like film through a camera.

Spool is a fork of [Paneru](https://github.com/karinushka/paneru), the original
Bevy-based macOS window manager. It preserves Paneru's core idea: windows live
on an infinite horizontal strip, and opening a new window never resizes the
existing layout. The project is renamed here to reflect the film-spool motion
of that strip while keeping the original project and its authorship explicit.

## About

Spool is a macOS window manager that arranges windows on an infinite strip,
extending to the right. A core principle is that opening a new window will
**never** cause existing windows to resize, maintaining your layout stability.

Each monitor operates with its own independent window strip, ensuring that
windows remain confined to their respective displays and do not "overflow" onto
adjacent monitors.

## Why Spool?

- **Niri-like Behavior on MacOS:** Inspired by the user experience of [Niri],
  Spool aims to bring a similar scrollable tiling workflow to MacOS.
- **Works with MacOS workspaces:** You can use existing workspaces and switch
  between them with keyboard or touchpad gestures - with a separate window strip
  on each. Drag and dropping windows between them works as well.
- **Virtual Workspaces (Experimental):** Group your windows into tasks by
  stacking multiple horizontal strips (rows) within a single space. Use native
  macOS workspaces for broad segregation (e.g., 'Work', 'Personal') and virtual
  workspaces to stay organized within each context.
- **Menu bar workspace indicator:** Shows the currently active virtual
  workspace in the macOS menu bar.
- **Startup session restore:** Restores managed window layouts, virtual
  workspaces, and display assignments from the last saved state when Spool
  starts.
- **Focus follows mouse on MacOS:** Very useful for people who would like to
  avoid an extra click.
- **Sliding windows with touchpad:** Using a touchpad is quite natural for
  navigation of the window pane.
- **Native macOS tabs support:** Applications like Ghostty use these, so
  Spool manages them on the layout strip like other windows.
- **Optimal for Large Displays:** Standard tiling window managers can be
  suboptimal for large displays, often resulting in either huge maximized
  windows or numerous tiny, unusable windows. Spool addresses this by
  providing a more flexible and practical arrangement.
- **Improved Small Display Usability:** On smaller displays (like laptops),
  traditional tiling can make windows too small to be productive, forcing users
  to constantly maximize. Spool's sliding strip approach aims to provide a
  better experience without this compromise.

## Inspiration

The fundamental architecture and window management techniques are heavily
inspired by [Yabai], another excellent MacOS window manager. Studying its
source code has provided invaluable insights into managing windows on MacOS,
particularly regarding undocumented functions.

The innovative concept of managing windows on a sliding strip is directly
inspired by [Niri] and [PaperWM.spoon].

## Installation

### Recommended System Options

- Like all non-native window managers for MacOS, Spool requires accessibility
  access to move windows. Once it runs you may get a dialog window asking for
  permissions. Otherwise check the setting in System Settings under "Privacy &
  Security -> Accessibility".

- Check your System Settings for "Displays have separate spaces" option. It
  should be enabled - this allows Spool to manage the workspaces independently.

- **Multiple displays**. Spool is moving the windows off-screen, hiding them
  to the left or right. If you have multiple displays, for example your laptop
  open when docked to an external monitor you may experience weird behavior.
  The issue is that when MacOS notices a window being moved too far off-screen
  it will relocate it to a different display - which confuses Spool! The
  solution is to change the spatial arrangement of your additional display -
  instead of having it to the left or right, move it above or below your main
  display.
  A [similar situation](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#proper-monitor-arrangement)
  exists with Aerospace window manager.
  An option exists (`horizontal_mouse_warp`) which can make a vertical
  arrangement of displays "feel" horizontal.

- **Off-screen window slivers**. Because macOS will forcibly relocate windows
  that are moved fully off-screen, Spool keeps a thin sliver of each
  off-screen window visible at the screen edge. The `sliver_width` and
  `sliver_height` options control the size of this sliver. This is a
  workaround for a macOS limitation, not a design choice.

### Installing from source

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/wxxxcxx/spool.git
$ cd spool
$ cargo build --release
$ cargo install --path .
```

It can run directly from the command line or as a service.
Note that you will need to grant accessibility privileges to the binary.

### Installing with Nix

See [`nix/README.md`](/nix/README.md).

### Configuration

Spool checks for configuration in following locations:

- `$HOME/.spool`
- `$HOME/.spool.toml`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/spool/spool.toml`

Additionally it allows overriding the location with `$SPOOL_CONFIG` environment variable.
If none of these files exists, Spool creates
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/spool/spool.toml` with the built-in defaults on first launch.

A Lua script (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/spool/init.lua`, `$HOME/.spool.lua`, or
`$SPOOL_LUA`) replaces the TOML rather than layering on top of it: when one
exists, no `spool.toml` is read, created, or watched.

You can use the following basic configuration as a starting point. For a
complete guide to all available options, keybindings, and window rules, see the
**[Configuration Guide](./CONFIGURATION.md)**.

```toml
# basic .spool.toml
[options]
focus_follows_mouse = true
mouse_follows_focus = true

[bindings]
window_focus_west = "cmd - h"
window_focus_east = "cmd - l"
window_resize = "alt - r"
window_center = "alt - c"
quit = "ctrl + alt - q"
```

Alternatively, the embedded Lua runtime can declare the entire configuration
via `spool.setup{...}`, making the TOML file optional — see the
**[Lua Scripting Guide](./SCRIPTING.md)**:

```lua
-- init.lua
spool.setup {
  options = { focus_follows_mouse = true, mouse_follows_focus = true },
  bindings = {
    ["window focus west"] = "cmd - h",
    ["window focus east"] = "cmd - l",
    ["quit"] = "ctrl + alt - q",
  },
}
```

### Live reloading

Changes made to the active configuration file are automatically reloaded while
Spool is running. This is useful for tweaking keyboard bindings and other
settings without restarting the application.

### Startup session restore

Spool saves managed window layout state to the user state directory
(`$XDG_STATE_HOME/spool/state.json`, usually
`~/.local/state/spool/state.json`) and loads it when Spool starts. During the
startup restore window, Spool matches reopened windows to the saved session and
restores their layout placement, virtual workspace row, and display assignment
where possible.

Restore is startup-only. After the configured startup grace period expires, new
or unmatched windows follow the normal configuration and window-rule behavior.
Saved windows that are not present are ignored by default and the restored
layout is compacted around the windows that were found. The behavior is
configured with `[restore]`; see the
**[Session Restore](./CONFIGURATION.md#session-restore)** section in the
configuration guide.

### Running as a service

```shell
$ spool install
$ spool start
```

### Installing an app launcher

To start Spool from Spotlight, Alfred, Raycast, or another application launcher,
install the lightweight app wrapper:

```shell
$ spool install-app
```

This creates `$HOME/Applications/Spool.app`. Opening the app starts the
installed Spool launch agent and exits immediately. Remove the wrapper with:

```shell
$ spool uninstall-app
```

### Running in the foreground

```shell
$ spool
```

### Sending Commands

Spool exposes a `send-cmd` subcommand that lets you control the running
instance from the command line over a Mach service
(`com.wxxxcxx.spool`). Any
command that can be bound to a hotkey can also be sent programmatically:

```shell
$ spool send-cmd <command> [args...]
```

| `restart`                  | Restart the Spool service                         |

Where `<direction>` is one of: `west`, `east`, `north`, `south`, `first`, `last`.
Window numbers are 1-based and count columns from left to right.

#### Examples

```shell
# Move focus one window to the right.
$ spool send-cmd window focus east

# Swap the current window to the left.
$ spool send-cmd window swap west

# Center and resize in one shot (two separate calls).
$ spool send-cmd window center && spool send-cmd window resize

# Balance all columns to the focused window's width.
$ spool send-cmd window balance

# Cycle backward through preset widths.
$ spool send-cmd window shrink

# Jump to the left-most window.
$ spool send-cmd window focus first

# Jump to the second window from the left.
$ spool send-cmd window focus 2

# Switch directly to virtual workspace 3.
$ spool send-cmd window virtualnum 3

# Send the focused window to virtual workspace 3 without following it.
$ spool send-cmd window virtualsendnum 3

# Focus an exact Spool-known window id.
$ spool send-cmd window focusid 321

# Select virtual workspace 3 on display 1.
$ spool send-cmd workspace select 1 3
```

### Querying and Subscribing to State

Spool also exposes structured JSON state for scripts and status bars:

```shell
$ spool query state --json
$ spool query virtual-workspaces --json
$ spool query active --json
$ spool subscribe --json
```

`query` prints a JSON snapshot and exits. `subscribe --json` keeps the channel
open and emits line-delimited JSON events for changes that integrations usually
care about, including focus changes, virtual workspace changes, window-list
changes, title changes, and display changes. See
[`QUERY_AND_SUBSCRIBE_FORMAT.md`](./QUERY_AND_SUBSCRIBE_FORMAT.md) for the
full payload contract.

#### Scripting ideas

Because `send-cmd` talks to the running daemon, you can drive Spool from shell
scripts, `cron` jobs, or other automation tools:

- **Launch-and-arrange workflow.** Open an application and immediately position
  it: `open -a Safari && sleep 0.5 && spool send-cmd window resize`.
- **One-key layout reset.** Use `spool send-cmd window balance` to make every
  column the same width as the focused window — great for resetting layouts
  after unplugging a monitor or when windows get shuffled.
- **Integration with other tools.** Pipe focus events from tools like
  [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org) or
  [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) into `spool send-cmd` for
  compound actions that go beyond a single hotkey.
- **Multi-display orchestration.** Move a window to the next display and
  immediately warp the mouse there:
  ```shell
  spool send-cmd window nextdisplay && spool send-cmd mouse nextdisplay
  ```
- **Status bar integration.** Use `spool query state --json` to render the
  initial workspace labels, then keep them current with `spool subscribe --json`.


## Future Enhancements

- More commands for manipulating windows: finegrained size adjustments, touchpad resizing, etc.
- Deeper scriptability building on the embedded Lua runtime, which already
  supports full configuration (`spool.setup`), event hooks (`spool.on`),
  keybindings (`spool.bind`), and state queries — see the **[Lua Scripting Guide](./SCRIPTING.md)**.

## Communication

Paneru's upstream community has a public Matrix room at
[`#paneru:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/%23paneru%3Amatrix.org). Questions
specific to Spool should be reported in this repository.

## Architecture Overview

For a detailed high-level overview of Spool's internal design, data flow, and
ECS patterns, please refer to the **[Architecture Guide](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

Spool's architecture is built around the **Bevy ECS (Entity Component
System)**, which manages the window manager's state as a collection of entities
(displays, workspaces, applications, and windows) and components.

The system is decoupled into three primary layers:

1.  **Platform Layer (`src/platform/`)**: Directly interfaces with macOS via `objc2` and Core Graphics. It runs the native Cocoa event loop and pumps OS events into a channel consumed by Bevy.
2.  **Management Layer (`src/manager/`)**: Defines OS-agnostic traits (`WindowManagerApi`, `WindowApi`) that abstract window manipulation. The macOS-specific implementations (`WindowManagerOS`, `WindowOS`) bridge these traits to the Accessibility and SkyLight APIs.
3.  **ECS Layer (`src/ecs/`)**: The "brain" of the application. Bevy systems process incoming events, handle input triggers, and manage animations.

### Repository Structure

- **`main` branch**: Contains the stable, released code.
- **`testing` branch**: Used for experimental features and architectural refactors. This branch is volatile and may be force-pushed.
