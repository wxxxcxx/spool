//! What a handler can ask the main thread for, and the cache in front of it.
//!
//! Every read here is a round trip: the worker sends a request carrying a
//! reply channel and *awaits* it, while the main thread answers from the ECS
//! in `serve_lua_queries`. Awaiting rather than blocking lets handlers
//! overlap — a handler parked on a read is not holding the interpreter.
//!
//! Two invariants:
//!
//! * **The caches are per batch, not per dispatch.** Handlers that overlap
//!   are reading the same frame's world, so [`DispatchWorld`] clears them
//!   only when the last dispatch in the batch finishes.
//! * **No borrow may be held across an await.** These are `RefCell`s on a
//!   single thread, so a borrow spanning a suspension point is not a wait —
//!   it is a `BorrowMutError` panic the moment another dispatch touches the
//!   same cell. Every read below takes what it needs, drops the borrow,
//!   *then* awaits.
