# Spool Window Management

Spool tracks ordinary macOS windows and arranges them within native Spaces while leaving macOS responsible for Space topology and membership.

## Language

**Tracked Window**:
An ordinary application window represented in Spool, regardless of whether it is tiled or floating.
_Avoid_: Managed window

**Ignored Window**:
A transient or system window that Spool deliberately does not track, such as a menu or system panel.
_Avoid_: Unmanaged window

**Tiled Window**:
A tracked window that occupies a position in a Space's layout strip.
_Avoid_: Managed window

**Floating Window**:
A tracked window that belongs to a native Space but does not occupy a position in its layout strip.
_Avoid_: Unmanaged window

**Window Visibility**:
Whether a tracked window is visible, minimized, or hidden. Visibility is independent of whether the window is tiled or floating.

**Native Space**:
A macOS-managed desktop or fullscreen Space. macOS owns its lifecycle, order, visibility, and window membership.
_Avoid_: Workspace, virtual workspace
