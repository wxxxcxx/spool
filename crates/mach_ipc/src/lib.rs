//! Typed channels between unrelated processes, over Mach ports.
//!
//! One process binds a well-known service name and holds a [`Receiver<T>`]; any
//! number of unrelated processes connect a [`Sender<T>`] to that name and send
//! it values, mirroring the shape of `std`'s channels:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
//! # #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] struct Request;
//! # #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] struct Response;
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), spool_mach_ipc::Error> {
//! use spool_mach_ipc::{RecvPort, SendPort};
//! # futures_lite::future::block_on(async {
//! // The daemon.
//! let receiver = spool_mach_ipc::Receiver::<Request>::bind("com.example.service")?;
//! let delivery = receiver.recv().await?;
//! if let Some(reply) = delivery.reply {
//!     reply.send(&Response)?;
//! }
//!
//! // A client, in some other process.
//! let sender = spool_mach_ipc::Sender::<Request>::connect("com.example.service")?;
//! let response: Response = sender.call(&Request).await?;
//!
//! // The same client with no executor to run on: same names, `_blocking`.
//! let response: Response = sender.call_blocking(&Request)?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # })
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Operations come in async/blocking pairs (`send`/`send_blocking`, and so on)
//! on [`SendPort`] and [`RecvPort`]. [`Receiver`] also implements [`Stream`]:
//! `poll_next` attempts a non-blocking receive and, when the port is empty,
//! registers the task's waker against a process-wide kqueue watching that port
//! (`EVFILT_MACHPORT`), rather than parking a thread on `mach_msg`.
//!
//! Values are encoded with `postcard`, which is why `T` is bounded by serde's
//! traits.
